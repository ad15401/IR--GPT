üß© Tech Stack
- Python
- Streamlit
- ChromaDB (Vector Database)
- SentenceTransformers
- Ollama (Local LLMs)
- NIST SP 800-61 & NIST CSF

üß† Architecture Overview
1. Retrieves relevant content from NIST-based playbooks via ChromaDB
2. Embeds text using SentenceTransformers
3. Feeds context + scenario into a local Ollama LLM
4. Produces structured recommendations (JSON) and analyst narrative

üß† Example Use Case
Scenario:
"Multiple failed logins followed by one success; file permissions modified on host."

IR-GPT retrieves guidance from NIST-aligned playbooks and provides:
- Analysis of event patterns
- Recommended containment and response actions
- Structured JSON fields for incident tracking systems

üß∞ Governance & Framework Mapping
- NIST SP 800-61: Detection, Analysis, Containment, Recovery phases
- NIST CSF: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover
- Designed for GRC analysts, SOC teams, and IR consultants
